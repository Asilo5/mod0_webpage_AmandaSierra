	<p class="loveForTravel"> 
       My love for travel I believe runs in the family. Two of my uncles have traveled world wide, taking my grandparents with them whenever they could. We are also a family of immigrants. My maternal grandparents moved from Spain to Venezuela for better opportunities for their children. My mother and I moved to California from Venezuela to California for the same reasons. I later moved back to the Europe in search of better opportunities as well, and moved in the span of 5 years to 3 different countries. 

       Traveling for me is just, self-care. I love learning new streets, new foods. I absolutely love hearing different languages, even if I don't understand. I love seeing how incredibly similar we all are around the globe, even if the countries are miles apart one sees a lot of similarities. Yet also a bit different in regards to cultures and family values, and yet very accepting of others. It's the little things you learn from each country and each person you meet that makes me so hungry to get to know it better.
